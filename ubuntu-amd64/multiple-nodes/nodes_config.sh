# Define where the backup pem key files for each node are (to be) stored.
# Make sure the pem files for each node are stored in $BACKUP_ALL_KEYS_FOLDER/xxxxxxxxxxxx

BACKUP_ALLKEYS_FOLDER="$HOME/elrond_backup_keys"	# where are the pem key files for each node stored?

# Define the nodes you want to run, $NODE_NAMES should be array of $NUMBER_OF_NODES strings.

# Define a $USE_KEYS array with the first 12 characters of the initialNodesPk's that should be re-used.
# For updating nodes, the number of elements in $USE_KEYS would normally equal $NUMBER_OF_NODES, but...
# if $NUMBER_OF_NODES > ${#USE_KEYS[@]}, then new pem key files will be created for the remaining nodes
# and these new pem key files will also be backed up in the $BACKUP_ALLKEYS_FOLDER.
# If the keys in $USE_KEYS are not found in the $BACKUP_ALLKEYS_FOLDER, then they will be searched
# in the existing node folders and copied to $BACKUP_ALLKEYS_FOLDER if necessary.
# The $..._KEYS arrays are parallel arrays, meaning their index corresponds with $USE_KEYS
